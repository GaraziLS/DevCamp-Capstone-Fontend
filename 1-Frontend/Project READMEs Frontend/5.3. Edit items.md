## First steps to add the edit functionality

We'll create a new handler in the **creation-manager** file that will edit items, but first we'll create another piece of state:

```
this.state = {
    randomGeneratorList: [],
    editGenerator: {}
        };
```

Now, for the handler, the next thing that we need to do is create a function that we are going to pass to the manager to listen for that click event.

```
 handleEditItem(item) {
        this.setState({
            editGenerator: item
        })
    }
```

Now we'll pass this, as props, to the calling of the generator-list in this file:

```
<div className="lower-part-wrapper">
    {this.state.randomGeneratorList.map(item => {
        return (<GeneratorList key={item.item_id} data={item} 
        handleDeleteItem={this.handleDeleteItem}
        handleEditItem={this.handleEditItem}
        handleClearEditItem={this.handleClearEditItem} />)
    })}
```

Now, in the **generator-list.js** file, we'll add the handler, just like we did with the delete one:

```
 <button className="generator-list-btn" onClick={() => this.props.handleEditItem(RawData)}>Edit</button>
```

Now we need to populate the form when an item's edit button is clicked. To do so, we need to connect the manager and the form. we'll create a new function to clear the state and to return it to the initial state, and we'll be passing that as a prop to the GeneratorList component calling:

```
 handleClearEditItem() {
        this.setState({
            editGenerator: {}
        })
    }

(...)

<div className="lower-part-wrapper">
     {this.state.randomGeneratorList.map(item => {
         return (<GeneratorList key={item.item_id} data={item} 
         handleDeleteItem={this.handleDeleteItem}
         handleEditItem={this.handleEditItem}
        handleClearEditItem={this.handleClearEditItem} />)
     })}
```

> Be sure to pass these two handlers (handleEditItem and handleClearEditItem) to the GeneratorForm component too.

```
<GeneratorForm
    handleSuccessfulFormSubmission={this.handleSuccessfulFormSubmission}
    handleFormSubmissionError={this.handleFormSubmissionError}
    handleEditItem={this.handleEditItem}
    handleClearEditItem={this.handleClearEditItem} />
```

In the **generator-form.js** file, we're going to create a new function that will serve as a lifehook. We'll call this below the bindings. This lifehook will check if an object has keys or not, and if does (because the length of it is greater than 0) it will populate the form.

```
componentDidUpdate() {
        if (Object.keys(this.props.handleEditItem).length > 0) {
            const {title, category, content } = this.props.handleEditItem
        }
    }
```

We need to convert the GeneratorList component into a class component. 

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

export default class GeneratorList extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
            RawData: this.props.data,
            title: "",
            category: "",
            content: ""
        }

    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <div className="item-list-wrapper">
                    <div className="items-in-list">
                        <h2>{this.state.RawData.item_id}</h2>
                        <h2>{this.state.RawData.item_title}</h2>
                    </div>

                    <div className="buttons">
                        <button className="generator-list-btn" onClick={() => this.props.handleEditItem(this.state.RawData)}>Edit</button>
                        <button className="generator-list-btn" onClick={() => this.props.handleDeleteItem(this.state.RawData)}>Delete</button>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    };
}
```

Once we do that, we can use componentDidUpdate to control updates. The componentDidUpdate (which goes to the **generator-form.js** file) method takes two parameters, prevProps and prevState, which are used to access the previous props and state of the component. The componentDidUpdate method is used to perform any necessary updates after the component has been updated. It is often used to update the componentâ€™s state or to perform some action based on the updated state or props.



So what that's going to do is it's going to take this object that got passed in and it's going to spread it out. It's going to grab each element and it's gonna store it in a variable.

However, every time a user is making a change such as typing in the form, the conditional is going to fire and clear everything out. To avoid this, we can call the clearPortfolioToEdit method inside this method. When this component changes is gonna skip the conditional 'cause it's gonna be empty already.
