## Adding route guards

The unlogged user won't be able to see the random generator creation page or the profile one. We need to hide those routes to them, and show them only when the user is authenticated.

We'll pass the LoginStatus state from the **app.js** file to the **navbar.js** file:

```
<Navbar LoggedInStatus= {this.state.LoginStatus} />
```

And now, in the **navbar.js** file, we'll use a ternary operator that displays the Create and Profile pages when the user is logged in: 

```
{props.LoggedInStatus === "LOGGED_IN" ?
       <NavLink exact to="/create" className="link" activeClassName="active-link"><FontAwesomeIcon icon='magic-wand-sparkles' /> Create</NavLink> : null}

{props.LoggedInStatus === "LOGGED_IN" ?
    <NavLink exact to="/users/:slug" className="link" activeClassName="active-link"><FontAwesomeIcon icon='id-card' /> Profile</NavLink> : null}
```

## Using a ternary operator to turn the login button into a log out button when we're logged in

We need to tell the user that they're logged in, and to do so we need to change the log in button of the navbar to a log out one to show up when they're logged in. To do so, we'll use a ternary operator.
